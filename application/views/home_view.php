        <h2>Hi, <label class="username"><?php echo $username; ?></label>! Welcome to UPLB-DA DNA Barcoding Project</h2>
         <p style="color: black;">We have sequenced the DNA barcodes (i.e. cytochrome c oxidase subunit I or COI gene of the mitochondrial genome) of common breeds/strains of farm animals in the Philippines.</p>
	 <p style="color: black;">DNA was extracted from blood samples.  The DNA barcode of the livestock and poultry breed/strain was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method.  Sequence divergences ("Kimura 2 parameter" or K2P differences) of the DNA barcode between the groups or taxa and a library of common livestock and poultry breeds/strains were analyzed.  A neighbour-joining (NJ) tree based on COI barcodes was also created to provide graphic representation of sequence divergences among the breed/strain specimens to confirm identification.</p>
